    <h1>How Dicer Works - In Detail</h1>
    <br>
    <a href="index.html">Back to home</a>
    <br>
      <h2>ActionCable - For Messaging</h2>
        <p>ActionCable is a Rails-specific implementation of web sockets that allows users to chat with each
        other live.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Complex Searches - Locations with Geokit Rails</h2>
        <p>Geokit Rails is a Rails gem that contacts the Google Geocoding API to find users' locations. In the search
        algorithm, it considers all of the things important to a DnD player in addition to if the found users are within
        the distance the person making the search is willing to travel to (and if the found user is also willing to
        travel as far as the person making the search is located).</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Adding Friends</h2>
        <p>Dicer supports the ability to add friends and block users to make the social experience it creates
        more enjoyable and safe for everyone.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Facebook Integration - To find Friends even Faster</h2>
        <p>Dicer allows users to connect to Facebook to see if their friends are also on Dicer. If so, these friends
        are added to the user's friend list to make finding other DnD users even faster.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>A Truly Original UI - Minimal Bootstrap or other CSS Frameworks </h2>
        <p>Except for a few uses of Bootstrap's column system, Dicer does not rely on any CSS framework
        to style its pages.</p>
